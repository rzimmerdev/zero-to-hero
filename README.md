# zero-to-hero
Create and deploy to production a simple neural network for Computer Vision


# Tools Used
* JAX Library for computing gradients, performing tensor operations and scheming the segmentation model
* Wandb for metrics and training tools
* MLflow for deploying and compiling the model for production
* Gradio for interactive user-experience platform within an online platform (Data-ICMC Website).
